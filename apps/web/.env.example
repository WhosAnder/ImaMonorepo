# =================================
# Web App Environment Configuration
# =================================

# Authentication Service URL (REQUIRED)
# Used for all auth-related API calls (login, logout, user management, password changes)
# IMPORTANT: Must be included in the ALLOWED_ORIGINS of the auth service
# Examples:
#   Local: http://localhost:5001
#   Railway: https://auth-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
#   Custom: https://auth.domain.com
# Default: http://localhost:5001
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:5001

# API Service URL (REQUIRED)
# Base URL for the main API service (reports, warehouse, templates, storage)
# IMPORTANT: Must be included in the ALLOWED_ORIGINS of the API service
# Examples:
#   Local: http://localhost:4000
#   Railway: https://api-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
#   Custom: https://api.domain.com
# Default: http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# S3 Presigner Base URL (OPTIONAL)
# Base URL for S3 presigned URL generation (defaults to NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL if not set)
# Used for direct file uploads to S3
# Examples:
#   Local: http://localhost:4000
#   Railway: https://api-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
#   Custom: https://api.domain.com
# Default: Same as NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_PRESIGNER_BASE=http://localhost:4000

# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# =================================
#
# For cross-subdomain cookie authentication to work properly:
#
# 1. Ensure the auth service has these environment variables set:
#    - ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Include your web app URL (e.g., https://web.railway.app or https://domain.com)
#    - COOKIE_DOMAIN: Set to parent domain (e.g., .railway.app or .domain.com)
#    - NODE_ENV: Set to "production"
#    - BETTER_AUTH_URL: Your auth service URL
#
# 2. Ensure the API service has these environment variables set:
#    - ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Include your web app URL
#    - NODE_ENV: Set to "production" (if applicable)
#
# 3. All services must use HTTPS in production (required for secure cookies)
#
# Example Railway setup:
#   Web:  https://web-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
#   Auth: https://auth-production-xxxx.up.railway.app (with COOKIE_DOMAIN=.railway.app)
#   API:  https://api-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
#
# Example Custom domain setup:
#   Web:  https://domain.com
#   Auth: https://auth.domain.com (with COOKIE_DOMAIN=.domain.com)
#   API:  https://api.domain.com
#
